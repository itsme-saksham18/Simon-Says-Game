# Simon-Says-Game

The Simon Says game is a simple memory game where you must follow an increasing sequence of colors. The game challenges your memory and attention by adding one more color to the sequence after each correct guess. It’s inspired by the classic Simon game.

How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
The game will begin with a sequence of color buttons.


2. Watch the first color blink.
A color will blink on the screen, indicating which button you must tap.


3. Tap the correct color.
After the color blinks, tap the corresponding color button.


4. Another color blinks if your answer is correct.
If you tap the correct button, the game will add a new color to the sequence, and you’ll need to repeat the previous sequence along with the new color.


5. Follow the sequence.
Continue to remember and tap the buttons in the exact order they blinked.


6. The game continues until you make a mistake.
If you tap the wrong button, the game will end, and your score (the length of the sequence you correctly followed) will be displayed.



Features

Simple interface with 4 color buttons.
